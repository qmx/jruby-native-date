# jruby-native-date

This plugin aims to provide a fast replacement for the stock ruby's stdlib date.

The work starts with providing a specialized parser to be used for both [strptime](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/date/rdoc/DateTime.html#method-c-strptime) and [strftime](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/date/rdoc/DateTime.html#method-i-strftime)
